# Content Buddy
*A Figma Plugin that helps you replace text content in multiple layers easily.*

Content Buddy searches for text content in your selection and displays a list with each unique text content, then you can select each content individually and set a replacement text for all the nodes where the original content appears.
Content Buddy works in instances, components, frames and groups but it can't replace text in layers with multiple text styles (a plugin API limitation for now).
